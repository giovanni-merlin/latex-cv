Check the CV [here](https://github.com/giovanni-merlin/latex-cv/blob/gh-pages/Giovanni_Merlin_CV.pdf)

This repository contains my CV compiled in LaTeX through a CI/CD pipeline and deployed to GitHub Pages.
The main reason for this repo is that on Overleaf checking previous versions is a paid feature.
